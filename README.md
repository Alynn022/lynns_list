## Overview
This is a group project incorporating a new stretch tech, TypeScript. Lynn's List is an application for users to maintain and keep track of what restaurants they have been to, want to visit, and/ or add to their personalized list. When a user first lands on the home page, they are able to view a list of individual restaurant information. A user is then able to create their own lists to add specific restaurants to, and can also view more information on the restaurant, by taking them to the yelp page of that restaurant. This application utilizes the Yelp Fushion API to bring the latest information on restarurants in Denver.

## Joint Learning Goal
Our learning goals together as a group were to be able to build this application using a new technology where none of us have had previous experience on. 

## Individual Reflection

Lynn - My learning goals was to do more cypress testing using intercepts and stubbing static data, which we added to all of tests. I also wanted to be more familiar with class and functional components, and with this project, was able to understand when it was better when use one over the other.
