## Overview
This is a group project incorporating a new stretch tech, TypeScript. Lynn's List is an application for users to maintain and keep track of what restaurants they have been to, want to visit, and/ or add to their personalized list. When a user first lands on the home page, they can view a list of individual restaurant information. A user is then able to create their own lists to add specific restaurants to. The user can also view more information on the restaurant, by taking them to the yelp page of that restaurant. This application utilizes the Yelp Fushion API to bring the latest information on restaurants in Denver.

## Joint Learning Goal
Our learning goal together as a group, was to build this application using a new technology, TypeScript, where none of us have had previous experience on. 

## Individual Reflection 
Ali - Learning goals were to continue gaining experience with React and dynamically rendering based on user input.

Daniel - My primary learning goal over the course of this project was to gain an understanding of strongly typed languages via Typescript. I also wanted to continue transferring the staples I learned in VanillaJS to React.

Jani - Incorporating TypeScript into React. Understanding how to refactor class components into hooks, and  potentially stretching into React Styled Components.

Lynn - My learning goals was to do more cypress testing using intercepts and stubbing static data. I also wanted to be more familiar with class and functional components in TypeScript, and with this project, was able to understand when it was better when use one over the other. 

## Future Enhancements
- Add more cities for users to search through
- Add filters for users to sort through types of restaurants 
- Add a search bar for users to search by name.
